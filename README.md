# The Odin Project - HTML Recipes

Simple website reinforcing the lesosns of linking mostly, linking to other pages as well as adding image sources. 

Overall, I'm glad that HTML is so easy linguistically speaking. Might not be the general vibe, but words like 'href' and 'src' and 'noopener' etc seem really familiar to my brain and hence baby to memorize. If this project takes me longer than 10 minutes to complete I'm gonna lose it lowkey

Edit post-completion: Took a decent amount of time but only because I didn't know you had to do 3 reps of the same thing. Finished in less than half an hour overall even with like 3 detours to find small recipes so I'll pat myself on the back.
